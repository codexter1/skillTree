## User 1:
Nathan is a single college student who attends a different school to all of his friends. He wants to pick up a new hobby and find others who share the same interests as him. He likes SkillTree because it is designed to connect people through their activities. His favorite feature is how easy it is to organize meet-ups, and to even help host them.

Georgina is a Grandmother, and wife. She and her husband are retired Americans. Their children and grandkids live in a different state, so they only see them occasionally. She and her husband want to start a vegetable garden, but have no experience. A friend tells her about SkillTree. The homepage is very clear on how to sign up, dedicating a large space to the sign-up form. Upon creating her profile, she is directed to choose tags of skills she is interested in. There are pre made tags, and custom ones. This connects her to a network of people and their pages, who are growing, or who already have grown in the areas she is interested in. She and her husband create a page together, and after following other SkillTree users, she begins to construct her own Skill Page for gardening. She links her page to other user's pages where relevant, and joins chat groups.
